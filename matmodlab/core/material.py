    """The material model base class

    Notes
    -----
    The `Material` class is a base class and is meant to be inherited by
    concrete implementations of material models. At minimum, the material model
    must provide an `eval` method that is called by the model driver to update
    the material state. See the documentation for `eval` for more details.

    For material models that require state dependent variable tracking, the
    `num_sdv` member must be set to the number of state dependent variables
    required. Optionally, the `sdv_names` member can also be set to a list of
    state dependent variable names (for output purposes). State dependent
    variables are initialized to 0. The method `sdvini` can optionally be
    defined that returns alternative values for state dependent variables. See
    the documentation for `sdvini` for more information.

        Parameters
        ----------

        -------
        statev : ndarray or None
            The initialized state dependent variables.

        Notes
        -----
        This base method does not need to be overwritten if a material does not
        have any state dependent variables, or their initial values should be
        zero.

        F0, F : ndarray
            Deformation gradient at the beginning and end of the step
        strain : ndarray
            Strain at the beginning of the step
        d : ndarray

            Stress at the end of the step
        statev : ndarray
            State variables at the end of the step
        ddsdde : ndarray
            Elastic stiffness (Jacobian) of the material

        Notes
        -----
        Each material model is responsible for returning the elastic stiffness.
        If an analytic elastic stiffness is not known, return `None` and it
        will be computed numerically.

        The input arrays `stress` and `statev` are mutable and copies are not
        passed in. DO NOT MODIFY THEM IN PLACE. Doing so can cause problems
        down stream.
