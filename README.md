# The Material Model Laboratory

## What is it?

The material model laboratory (*Matmodlab*) is a material point simulator developed as a tool for developing and analyzing material models for use in larger finite element codes.

## System Requirements

*matmodlab* has been built and tested extensively on several versions of linux
and the Apple Mac OSX 10 operating systems.

### Required Software

*matmodlab* requires the following software installed for your platform:

- [Python (2.7 or greater)](http://www.python.org) or newer

- [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org)


*Matmodlab* is developed and tested using the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io) Python distributions.

### Optional Software

- [Pandas](http://www.pandas.pydata.org)

- [py.test](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest)

## Documentation

The documentation consists of Jupyter notebooks contained in the `matmodlab/notebooks` directory and vieweable at [Introduction to Matmodlab](https://github.com/tjfulle/matmodlab2/blob/master/matmodlab/notebooks/Introduction.ipynb)
