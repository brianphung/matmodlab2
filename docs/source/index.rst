The Material Model Laboratory
#############################

The Material Model Laboratory (*Matmodlab2*) is a single element material model
driver aimed at developers of constitutive routines targeted for deployment in
finite element codes.

This documentation is separated into two main parts:

* This collection of static web pages
* A growing collection of `Jupyter Notebooks <https://github.com/tjfulle/matmodlab2/blob/master/notebooks/GettingStarted.ipynb>`_

License
=======

*Matmodlab2* is an open source project licensed under the `MIT <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_ license.

Obtaining and Installing Matmodlab2
===================================

*Matmodlab2* is maintained with git and can be obtained from `<https://github.com/tjfulle/matmodlab2>`_.  To install *Matmodlab2*, obtain a copy (by cloning or downloading) of the source code and add the path to the ``matmodlab2`` root directory to your ``PYTHONPATH``.

Acknowledgments
===============

The inspiration for *Matmodlab2* came from Dr. `Rebecca Brannon's <http://www.mech.utah.edu/~brannon/>`_ *MED* material point driver and Tom Pucicks's *MMD* driver, developed at Sandia National Labs.

The syntax and documentation have been greatly influenced by the authors' exposure and use of research codes at Sandia National Labs and other commercial finite element codes, notably `Abaqus <http://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/latest-release>`_.

Obtaining Additional Help
=========================

In addition to this guide, many examples can be found in
``matmodlab2/notebooks`` and ``matmodlab2/tests``
